NOTICE:
 > YES, THERE ARE SOME REDUNDANT STATS IN HERE.
 > YES, THEY ARE ALL NEEDED. For instance, if you want to add immunity to something like mudslow, add fumudslow AND mudslow.

 > [0-Relative] means that THE STATS ARE ORIENTED AROUND 0. This means that the default state is 0. These must use [amount] or [effectiveMultiplier]. [effectiveMultiplier] will only have an effect if other sources use [amount]!
 > [X-Relative] means that THE STATS ARE ORIENTED AROUND X (As example:1). Default values are stated.

 > [baseMultiplier]: This means that the default state is X (100%). Values < 1 subtract from this stat, and values > 1 add to this stat. (e.g. 0.5 means "50% of this stat's value")
 > [effectiveMultiplier]: applies a multiplier. 0.5 means half of whatever the stat currently is. 2 means twice.

 > [armorStatA]: stats that use [amount] on armor stat lists and [effectiveMultiplier] on pretty much every other case
 > [armorStatB]: stats that use [baseMultiplier] on armor stat lists and [effectiveMultiplier] on pretty much every other case

 > [boolean] means that THE VALUE IS A SWITCH, AND MUST BE OFF (0) OR ON (1). No other values are legal. that said, typically any value that isnt 0 is treated as true.

 > [fixed]: special case. stat comes only in specific values

 > [Variant]: it has specific cases it can be, but varies by context.
